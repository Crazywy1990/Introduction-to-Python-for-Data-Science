--Import the math package. Now you can access the constant pi with math.pi.
Calculate the circumference of the circle and store it in C.
Calculate the area of the circle and store it in A.

# Definition of radius
r = 0.43

# Import the math package
import math

# Calculate C
C = 2*math.pi*r

# Calculate A
A = math.pi * r**2

# Build printout
print("Circumference: " + str(C))
print("Area: " + str(A))

--General imports, like import math, make all functionality from the math package available to you. However, if you decide to only use a specific part of a package, you can always make your import more selective:

from math import pi
--Perform a selective import from the math package where you only import the radians function.
Calculate the distance travelled by the Moon over 12 degrees of its orbit. Assign the result to dist. You can calculate this as r∗ϕr∗ϕ, where rr is the radius and ϕϕ is the angle in radians. To convert an angle in degrees to an angle in radians, use the radians() function, which you just imported.
Print out dist.
# Definition of radius
r = 192500

# Import radians function of math package
from math import radians

# Travel distance of Moon if 12 degrees. Store in dist.
dist = r * radians(12)

# Print out dist
print (dist)
