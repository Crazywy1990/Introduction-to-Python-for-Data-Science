--Equality
--In the editor on the right, write code to see if True equals False.
Write Python code to check if -5 * 15 is not equal to 75.
Ask Python whether the strings "pyscript" and "PyScript" are equal.
What happens if you compare booleans and integers? Write code to see if True and 1 are equal.

# Comparison of booleans
print (True == False)

# Comparison of integers
print (-5 * 15 != 75)

# Comparison of strings
print ("pyscript" == "PyScript")

# Compare a boolean with an integer
print (True == 1)

2.--Greater and Less than
--Remember that for string comparison, Python determines the relationship based on alphabetical order.
--Write Python expressions, wrapped in a print() function, to check whether:

x is greater than or equal to -10. x has already been defined for you.
"test" is less than or equal to y. y has already been deinfed for you.
True is greater than False.

# Comparison of integers
x = -3 * 6
print (x >= -10)

# Comparison of strings
y = "test"
print ("test" <= y)

# Comparison of booleans
print (True > False)

3.--and, or, not
--Write Python expressions, wrapped in a print() function, to check whether:

# Define variables
my_kitchen = 18.0
your_kitchen = 14.0

# my_kitchen bigger than 10 and smaller than 18?
print (my_kitchen > 10 and my_kitchen < 18)

# my_kitchen smaller than 14 or bigger than 17?
print (my_kitchen < 14 or my_kitchen > 17)

# Double my_kitchen smaller than triple your_kitchen?
print (my_kitchen*2 < your_kitchen*3)

4.--If
--Examine the if statement that prints out "Looking around in the kitchen." if room equals "kit".
Write another if statement that prints out "big place!" if area is greater than 15.

# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if statement for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")

# if statement for area
if area > 15:
        print("big place!" )


--Add an else statement to the second control structure so that "pretty small." is printed out if area > 15 evaluates to False.

# Define variables
room = "kit"
area = 14.0

# if-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")
else :
    print("looking around elsewhere.")

# if-else construct for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
else:
    print("pretty small.")
    
    
--Add an elif to the second control structure such that "medium size, nice!" is printed out if area is greater than 10.
# Define variables
room = "bed"
area = 14.0

# if-elif-else construct for room
if room == "kit" :
    print("looking around in the kitchen.")
elif room == "bed":
    print("looking around in the bedroom.")
else :
    print("looking around elsewhere.")

# if-elif-else construct for area
if area > 15 :
    print("big place!")
elif area > 10:
    print("medium size, nice!")
else :
    print("pretty small.")
