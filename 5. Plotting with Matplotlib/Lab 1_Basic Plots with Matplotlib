--Line Plot
--print() the last item from both the year and the pop list to see what the predicted population for the year 2100 is.
Before you can start, you should import matplotlib.pyplot as plt. pyplot is a sub-package of matplotlib, hence the dot.
Use plt.plot() to build a line plot. year should be mapped on the horizontal axis, pop on the vertical axis. Don't forget to finish off with the show() function to actually display the plot.

# Print the last item from year and pop
print (year[-1])
print (pop[-1])

# Import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Make a line plot: year on the x-axis, pop on the y-axis
plt.plot(year,pop)
plt.show()

4.--Scatter Plot
Change the line plot that's coded in the script to a scatter plot.
A correlation will become clear when you display the GDP per capita on a logarithmic scale. Add the line plt.xscale('log').
Finish off you# Change the line plot below to a scatter plot
plt.scatter(gdp_cap, life_exp)

# Put the x-axis on a logarithmic scale
plt.xscale('log')

# Show plot
plt.show()r script with plt.show() to display the plot.

 5.--Scatter Plot (2)
 --Start from scratch: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt.
Build a scatter plot, where pop is mapped on the horizontal axis, and life_exp is mapped on the vertical axis.
Finish the script with plt.show() to actually display the plot. Do you see a correlation?

# Import package
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Build Scatter plot
plt.scatter(pop,life_exp)

# Show plot
plt.show()
