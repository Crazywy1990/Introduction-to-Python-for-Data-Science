--Build a histogram
--Use plt.hist() to create a histogram of the values in life_exp. Do not specify the number of bins; Python will set the number of bins to 10 by default for you.
Add plt.show() to actually display the histogram. Can you tell which bin contains the most observations?

# Create histogram of life_exp data
plt.hist(life_exp)

# Display histogram
plt.show()

2.--Build a Histogram (bins)
--Build a histogram of life_exp, with 5 bins. Can you tell which bin contains the most observations?
Build another histogram of life_exp, this time with 20 bins. Is this better?
 
#plt.close() will close the figure window entirely, where plt.clf() will just clear the figure - you can still paint another plot onto it.

# Build histogram with 5 bins
plt.hist(life_exp, bins = 5)

# Show and clean up plot
plt.show()
plt.clf()

# Build histogram with 20 bins
plt.hist(life_exp, bins = 20)

# Show and clean up again
plt.show()
plt.clf()
