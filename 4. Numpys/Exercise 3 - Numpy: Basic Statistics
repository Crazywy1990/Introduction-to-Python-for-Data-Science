1.--Create Numpy array np_height, that is equal to first column of np_baseball.
Print out the mean of np_height.
Print out the median of np_height.

## np_baseball is available

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create np_height from np_baseball
np_height = np_baseball[:,0]

# Print out the mean of np_height
print (np.mean(np_height))

# Print out the median of np_height
print (np.median(np_height)) np_baseball is available

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create np_height from np_baseball
np_height = np_baseball[:,0]

# Print out the mean of np_height
print (np.mean(np_height))

# Print out the median of np_height
print (np.median(np_height))

2.--The code to print out the mean height is already included. Complete the code for the median height. Replace None with the correct code.
Use np.std() on the first column of np_baseball to calculate stddev. Replace None with the correct code.
Do big players tend to be heavier? Use np.corrcoef() to store the correlation between the first and second column of np_baseball in corr. Replace None with the correct code.

# np_baseball is available

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Print mean height (first column)
avg = np.mean(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Average: " + str(avg))

# Print median height. Replace 'None'
med = np.median(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Median: " + str(med))

# Print out the standard deviation on height. Replace 'None'
stddev = np.std(np_baseball[:,0])
print("Standard Deviation: " + str(stddev))

# Print out correlation between first and second column. Replace 'None'
corr = np.corrcoef(np_baseball[:,0],np_baseball[:,1])
print("Correlation: " + str(corr))

3.--Convert heights and positions, which are regular lists, to numpy arrays. Call them np_heights and np_positions.
Extract all the heights of the goalkeepers. You can use a little trick here: use np_positions == 'GK' as an index for np_heights. Assign the result to gk_heights.
Extract all the heights of the all the other players. This time use np_positions != 'GK' as an index for np_heights. Assign the result to other_heights.
Print out the median height of the goalkeepers using np.median(). Replace None with the correct code.
Do the same for the other players. Print out their median height. Replace None with the correct code.
