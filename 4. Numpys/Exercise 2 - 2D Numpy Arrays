1.--Use np.array() to create a 2D Numpy array from baseball. Name it np_baseball.
Print out the type of np_baseball.
Print out the shape attribute of np_baseball. Use np_baseball.shape.

# Create baseball, a list of lists
baseball = [[180, 78.4],
            [215, 102.7],
            [210, 98.5],
            [188, 75.2]]

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the type of np_baseball
print (type (np_baseball))

# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print (np_baseball.shape)

2.--np_baseball

# baseball is available as a regular list of lists

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create a 2D Numpy array from baseball: np_baseball
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out the shape of np_baseball
print (np_baseball.shape)

4.--You managed to get hold on the changes in weight, height and age of all baseball players. It is available as a 2D Numpy array, update. Add np_baseball and update and print out the result.
You want to convert the units of height and weight. As a first step, create a Numpy array with three values: 0.0254, 0.453592 and 1. Name this array conversion.
Multiply np_baseball with conversion and print out the result.

# baseball is available as a regular list of lists
# update is available as 2D Numpy array

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and update
print (np_baseball + update)

# Create Numpy array: conversion
conversion = np.array([0.0254,0.453592,1])

# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
print (np_baseball * conversion)
